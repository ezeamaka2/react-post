# React Router v6 Project

``npm install react-router-dom@6``

``yarn add react-router-dom@6``

This repo is a practice project. I created a multi page react project with React Router v6(latest).
I included a post page, where I fetched 100 posts from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and listed them on the post page
I also included the feture of see more details about a particular post and added route to go back to all post.
